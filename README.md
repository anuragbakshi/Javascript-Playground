#### Javascript can be glitch free.

Inspired by Apple's Swift Playground, JSPlayground lets users see their code run at editing time. This Ace-Editor-integrated debug assistant provides information about variables, functions, function calls and loop statements in Javascript code. The outputted metadata is then displayed side by side with the original code in a manner clear for navigation. The editor even catches infinite loops and run time errors - no more browser freezes, no more panic!

You are welcome to try out JSPlayground [here](http://jslikeswift.appspot.com/)!
